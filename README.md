# Flutter Video/Audio Call Simulator

This Flutter app simulates video and audio call functionality, allowing users to initiate calls, accept/reject incoming calls, and interact with in-call controls such as muting/unmuting, switching cameras (for video calls), and ending calls.

## Features Implemented

1. Idle Screen:

Displays options for the user to initiate either an Audio Call or a Video Call.


2. Incoming Call Screen:

Shows a dialog box when there is an incoming call.
The user can either Accept or Reject the call.


3. In-Call Screen:

Displays either a video feed (if it's a video call) or a placeholder icon (for audio calls).
Shows the call duration (formatted as HH:MM:SS).


4. Call Timer:

A timer starts when the call is answered, tracking the call duration.

5. Call Controls:

Mute/Unmute: Toggles microphone on or off.
Switch Camera: Switches between the front and back camera (for video calls).
End Call: Ends the current call.
